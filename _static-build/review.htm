        <p>This is my first review for the newly-launched Tdw! This blog is for practical whiskey advice, I swear, but I can't resist. I chose this particular whiskey to post first because it is, to date, my favorite drink ever. It’s my yardstick. Everything that comes after, I'm comparing to this.</p>
        <p>So back in the eighties, as the story goes, a customer bought 95 barrels of rye from <a href="#0">Heaven Hill</a> to be aged to taste and privately bottled. Fortunately for us all, the customer never showed up to claim them until they were over-aged (hah), prompting Heaven Hill to buy them back and offer them up for sale.</p>
        <p>That’s good for us because not many hyper-aged ryes tend to make it to the shelves. Rye had a slump in the 70s and 80s (Heaven Hill was one of a few producers to keep making it), and before its current boom was considered neither fashionable nor elegant; nobody stowed barrels of this away because nobody could have predicted the demand there is today. The few that happen to make it to market, though, are almost universally lauded.</p>
        <p>Rittenhouse 25-year was a one-time release of around 3000 bottles in 2009, the last of three releases following 21- and 23-year expressions. It was distilled in 1984, then aged in the coolest part of floor 1 of Heaven Hill’s rickhouse OO, allowing for gentler aging and preventing it from being an oaky mess.</p>
        <p>It's a non-chill-filtered straight rye. It's a single-barrel product, which means my experience will be at least slightly different than yours. My bottle is number 47 from barrel #2. Let's do this.</p>
